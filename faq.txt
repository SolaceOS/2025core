    <h1>FAQ & ESG Compliance</h1>

    <div class="color-section color1">
      <h2>What is fallback logistics?</h2>
      <p>Fallback logistics refers to the ability to detect a disruption and automatically reroute, resupply, or simulate an alternate path — before delays or failures cause losses.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="color-section color2">
      <h2>How does Solace ensure ESG compliance?</h2>
      <p>Solace Profiles are ESG-aligned. Every fallback route includes emissions, impact, and equity logic, and all decisions are exportable for reporting or audits.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="color-section color3">
      <h2>Can I export fallback decisions?</h2>
      <p>Yes. Every fallback scenario can be exported in ESG format, SLA format, and audit-ready reports for internal or regulatory proof.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="color-section color2">
      <h2>Which industries does Solace support?</h2>
      <p>Pharma, Defense, Government, Retail, Cold Chain, Utilities, and over 100 verticals across logistics, operations, and sovereign systems.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="color-section color1">
      <h2>What happens after a simulation?</h2>
      <p>Once fallback is confirmed in simulation, Solace can export logic to your systems, trigger LOIs, or activate pilots based on the outcomes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="color-section color3">
      <h2>How Solace Works: Behind the Scenes</h2>
      <p>Solace Profiles are powered by patent-backed logic that simulates disruptions before they happen — and activates fallback responses in real time.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Autonomous fallback agents</li>
        <li>Federated profile syncing</li>
        <li>ESG and SLA constraint-based rerouting</li>
        <li>Simulation replay and export logic</li>
      </ul>
      <p>During early deployment, all fallback routes are approved manually by your team. Once scaled, agent logic will operate autonomously — rerouting freight, power, or relief before damage occurs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="color-section color1">
      <h2>Defensibility: Powered by 30+ Patents</h2>
      <p>Solace has filed over 30 foundational patents covering fallback orchestration, agent coordination, ESG routing, logic export, and sovereign-grade resilience. Every profile you run is protected by this IP fortress.</p>
